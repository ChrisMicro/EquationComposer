# Equation Composer
Arduino Synthesizer Library for 32 bit microcontrollers

This library is based on the EQUATION composer of [Microbe Modular how to](/doc/HowTo.md).

To create various synthesizers you can use the graphical user interface espnode86

[espnode86 GUI](https://esptiny86.github.io/espnode86/)

With this graphical user interface you can create a c-code file which you can compile together with your Arduino code. The result is the synthesizer.

To use this library you need to install the corresponding Arduino framework for the specific microcontroller.

Following Microcontrollers were tested:

ESP6266

[ ESP8266 Framework Installation ](http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.0.0/doc/installing.html)


Use graphical node creator from Budi Prakosa to create synth patches:
